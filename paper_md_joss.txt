# Summary
**ARBE λ\*** (*Absorption-Reflection Balance Edge*) is a spectral index that identifies the balance point between absorption and reflection in the visible spectrum. Unlike perceptual colour models such as CIELAB or HLC, λ\* is derived from spectral reflectance data, offering a physically grounded, material-consistent scalar value. This enables more reliable comparisons in quality assurance (QA), pigment formulation, and research contexts.

The toolkit includes a Google Colab/Jupyter notebook (`arbe_lambda_demo.ipynb`) for computing λ\*, visualizing results in CIELAB and HLC, calculating ΔE2000 differences, and generating PDF/CSV reports. It supports CSV, JSON, and CGATS formats, and integrates seamlessly with the HLC Colour Atlas XL dataset.

## Statement of Need
Traditional colour difference metrics (e.g., CIELAB, ΔE2000) do not capture the underlying spectral balance of materials, limiting their accuracy in QA and production workflows. ARBE λ\* addresses this by providing a reproducible, open, spectrum-derived metric that bridges the gap between physical colour measurements and perceptual models.

## State of the Field
While CIELAB, HLC, and ΔE formulas are widely used, they are primarily perceptual and device-dependent. ARBE λ\* adds a spectral, device-independent metric to complement these, improving accuracy for physical samples in industrial and research applications.

## Installation
```bash
pip install colour-science pandas numpy scipy plotly matplotlib
```
Or run directly in Google Colab without installation.

## Usage Example
Open `arbe_lambda_demo.ipynb` in Google Colab or Jupyter to interactively load spectral datasets, compute λ\* for thousands of samples, and visualize results using histograms, filters, and CIELAB scatter plots. The notebook includes a fallback for manual CSV upload and demonstrates all major features of the ARBE λ\* toolkit.
